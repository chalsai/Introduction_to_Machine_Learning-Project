HR Analytics

Instructions


Background Information
HR analytics is revolutionising the way human resources departments operate, leading
to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources have been using
analytics for years. However, the collection, processing, and analysis of data have been
largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the
approach has been constraining HR. Therefore, it is surprising that HR departments
woke up to the utility of machine learning so late in the game.


Objective

Build model to predict eligibility for an employee to be promoted or not
About The Dataset

This dataset is obtained from HR_Analytics_Classification | Kaggle


Main Instructions

#Exploratory analysis from the data, create some visualization to describe the data

#Describe the pre-processing step, how to extract and create new features, also the reason behind them

#Split the data into training and testing with optional portion

#Build the models with matching hyperparameter tune, choose the best model, also the reason behind that

#Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for
accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.
