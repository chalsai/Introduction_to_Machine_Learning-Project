Background Information
HR analytics is revolutionising the way human resources departments operate, leading
to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources have been using
analytics for years. However, the collection, processing, and analysis of data have been
largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the
approach has been constraining HR. Therefore, it is surprising that HR departments
woke up to the utility of machine learning so late in the game.
